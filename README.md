# Store-Managing-and-Billing-Program

It is a store-managing programme in C++, built as a console application where you can add, remove, and modify product details. View the product menu and make a bill with a discounting system. I have used classes, arrays, dynamic memory allocation, and STL concepts to make it simple and user-friendly.
